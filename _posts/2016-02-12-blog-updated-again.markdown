**Reason:** Formated computer and lost necessary files to update my old one which was based on Ghost platform and Hugobot (or something like that).

To read the documentation and try to figure how to remake the old one would have required some of my time, and at the moment I'm deep in learning some harder-for-me concepts (data structures, pointers). Yes I learn C.

So here comes the new blog which I hope to update daily with what I learned.
The topics of this blog will change to a bit more theoretical and technical. The content will relate to CS, Programming and not hype.

Meta:
Blog is now based on Jekyll 3.
